# Document_Keeper_Grupp1_Newton
A school project that will allow digital storage of documents such as create, import, scan, save and organize documents. 

## Installing
The project will not run unless a database is connected. Important to name the database correctly.
Please note that "create file" function only works on windows!
How to setup your Database:

```
  1, In NetBeans, click on "services" to the left. You should have "Java DB" under "Databases". Create a Database
  2, Name the DB "DocumentKeeperDB" and set root/root as credentials.
  3, Right click and connect to the database. A Derby localhost connection appears and you can right click and "Execute Command..."
  4, Run the code which you can find in DBscript.txt. You should have the database online!

```
